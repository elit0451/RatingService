# Bookings Rating Service :open_file_folder:
The objective of this project is to develop a software solution implementing _microservices architecture_ using **continuous integration**, **deployment**, **composition**, and **orchestration**. A previously developed system for [booking of cars](https://github.com/elit0451/EIPatterns) is used as part of our business case :oncoming_automobile:. With this repository, we provide expansion for rating any type of services :chart: - in our case we make use of it to collect feedback, regarding the quality of the car booking service.

## Use case :briefcase:
When a _user_ participates in our anonymous questionnaire they are presented with 2 courses:  
> **1. Mandatory**</br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Provide a grade (from 0-10)</br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Provide a short description

> **2. Optional**</br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Provide country of living</br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- State gender</br>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- State age

:exclamation:All parameters influence the rate. The intention is to use the collected data for further analysis and predictions :file_cabinet:.

</br>

The _administration_ can pull records using 3 **filters**:
>&nbsp;- average grade</br>&nbsp;- average age</br>&nbsp;- average gender

</br>

We have created 3 services within this project: 

**Client** - This is the main CLI that a customer can interact with. It takes input from the user and using a queue sends the collected information to the _Collector_ service.  

**Collector** - It has an active listener for information coming from the _Client_. Once a questionnaire is completed we normalize the data into the desired format and send it over to the _Admin_ service using socket connection. 

**Admin** - The _Admin_ service is used for querying the registered questionnaires.

</br>

Docker images are created for all of them and deployed to Docker hub - [client](https://hub.docker.com/r/davi7816/si-client), [collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/davi7816/si-collector), [admin](https://hub.docker.com/r/davi7816/si-admin).

</br>

## CI/CD :link:
For continuous integration, we use the CircleCI pipeline which will execute commands specified in the [config.yml](https://github.com/elit0451/RatingService/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) file. The current integration process is getting all the necessary dependencies, building .Net Core source code and building docker images uploaded to docker hub. For the Collector service, we also run a deploy script on a Digital Ocean droplet.
